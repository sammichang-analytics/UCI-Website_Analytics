The goal of this project was to follow the leads to the UCI Paul Merage Website. We focused on the business school's Specialty Masters Programs. 
It was an overcompassing project to analyze multiple aspects of the traffic and application data. 
Regressions were used to determine:
1) whether Facebook or Instagram brought more traffic to the website 
2) whether web applications or event registrations led to a tendency of the student to apply for a program.

An interesting survival analysis was also done to see the difference between the application times between international and domestic students.
